    "summary": "Artificial intelligence, data analytics, scientific impact, science of science, data science. We find that the area is in the sustainable development and its impact continues to grow. From the perspective of reference behavior, the decrease in self-references, we identified outline landmarks in the development of this field. Last but not least, we explore the inner structure in terms of topics\u2019 evolution over time. We have quantified the temporal trends at the topic level and discovered the inner connection among these topics. These findings provide deep insights into the current scientific innovations, as well as shedding light on funding policies. The study is performed on a large-scale dataset which consists of 58,447 publications and 12 top-tier conferences.",
