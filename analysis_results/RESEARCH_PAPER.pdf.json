    "summary": "Cloud computing is gaining popularity among businesses because it improves speed, efficiency, outcomes, reliability, and security. Cloud forensics has advanced due to advancements in Big Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, and machine learning. A detailed comparative analysis of differentapproaches of machine learning, deep learning, neural networks has been presented in the paper. The paper also provides a detail information on cloud forensics as well as the research trends that have been going on in this field over the past few years. The review paper seeks tocomprehend the significance of various machine learning models which would helpcloud forensics advance significantly. It also provides an overview of the research that has been done in the field of digital forensics.",
