    "summary": "This paper introduces a classifierapproach for prediction of weather condition. It shows how the Naive Bayes and Chi square algorithm can be utilized for classification purpose. The project aimsto estimate the weather by utilizing predictive analysis. It is a web application with a graphical User Interface. User will login to the system utilizing his user ID and password. It will take some information such as current outlook, temperature, Humidity and wind condition. This system will take this information and predict weather after analyzing the input information with the information in database. Using two basic functions to be specific classification (training) and testing (testing) will be performed. The outcomes demonstrated that these data mining procedures can besufficient for weather forecasting.",
